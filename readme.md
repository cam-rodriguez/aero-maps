# aero maps
going to try and tinker with sectional charts, sourced from the library of congress & the faa. :) 

### goals?
no goals. just fun. maybe try and get some of these features digitized; at bare minimum, get them georeferenced. see how things change over time. 


### scope?
trying to look at chicago/that airspace range, for as far back as i can! :)
